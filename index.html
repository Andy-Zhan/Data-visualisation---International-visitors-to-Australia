        <h3>Visitors by country of residence</h3>
        <p>
          Apart from the sharp drop of over 80 percent due to COVID-19 travel
          restrictions, the total number of foreign visitors has quite steadily
          increased over the past three decades, peaking at almost
          <span style="font-weight: bold">9.5 million</span> visitors in
          <span style="font-weight: bold">2019</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, Australia receives the most visitors from
          <span style="font-weight: bold">China</span>, and remains an extremely
          popular destination for
          <span style="font-weight: bold">New Zealanders</span>. Among the top
          10 source countries, the last decade has seen strong growth from Asian
          countries.

          The chart below shows the trends in the main reason for visiting as
          stated by foreign visitors to Australia, normalised by the total
          number of visits each year.

          <span style="color: #76b7b2; font-weight: bold">Holidays</span> have
          consistently been the most popular reason for visiting Australia,
          followed by

        <h3>Visits by month</h3>
        <p>
          The chart below shows the popularity of each month for foreign
          visitors. For each month, this is expressed as the percentage of
          yearly visitors that visited during that month, averaged across all
          the included years.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chart also shows the average minimum and maximum temperatures for
          each month. In general, visitors seem to prefer the warmer weather,
          with <span style="font-weight: bold">December</span> being the most
          popular month on average, followed by February. However, the increase
          in visitors during
          <span style="font-weight: bold">July</span> indicates that Australia
          may also be a popular destination for Northern Hemispheric visitors to
          escape the summer heat.
