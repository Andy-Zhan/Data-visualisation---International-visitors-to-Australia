          Apart from the sharp drop of over 80 percent due to COVID-19 travel
          restrictions, the total number of foreign visitors has quite steadily
          increased over the past three decades, peaking at almost 9.5 million
          visitors in 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, Australia receives the most visitors from China, and
          remains an extremely popular destination for New Zealanders. Among the
          top 10 source countries, the last decade has seen strong growth from
          Asian countries.
