        <h3>Visitors by country of residence</h3>
        <p><i>Where do Australia's visitors come from?</i></p>
        <p>
          The map below shows the countries that visitors originate from. The
          size of a country's dot represents how many visitors come from that
          country.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from the sharp drop of over 80 percent due to COVID-19 travel
          restrictions, the total number of foreign visitors has quite steadily
          increased over the past three decades, peaking at almost
          <span style="font-weight: bold">9.5 million</span> visitors in
          <span style="font-weight: bold">2019</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, Australia receives the most visitors from
          <span style="font-weight: bold">China</span>, and remains an extremely
          popular destination for
          <span style="font-weight: bold">New Zealanders</span>. Among the top
          10 source countries, the last decade has seen strong growth from Asian
          countries.

        <h3>Reasons for visiting</h3>
        <p><i>Why do people visit Australia?</i></p>
        <p>
          The chart below shows the trends in the main reason for visiting as
          stated by foreign visitors to Australia, normalised by the total
          number of visits each year.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="color: #76b7b2; font-weight: bold">Holidays</span> have
          consistently been the most popular reason for visiting Australia,
          followed by
          <span style="color: #b07aa1; font-weight: bold"
            >visiting friends and relatives.</span
          >
          However, the number of holiday visitors is slowly decreasing, while
          the number of people visiting relatives is increasing. This is likely
          due to the increasing numbers of immigrants living in Australia.

        <h3>Visits by month</h3>
        <p><i>When do people prefer to visit Australia?</i></p>
        <p>
          The chart below shows the popularity of each month for foreign
          visitors. For each month, this is expressed as the percentage of
          yearly visitors that visited during that month, aggregated across all
          the included years.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chart also shows the average minimum and maximum temperatures for
          each month. In general, visitors seem to prefer the warmer weather,
          with <span style="font-weight: bold">December</span> being the most
          popular month on average, followed by February. However, the increase
          in visitors during
          <span style="font-weight: bold">July</span> indicates that Australia
          may also be a popular destination for Northern Hemispheric visitors to
          escape the summer heat.

        <h3>Visitor count and average spend for popular locations</h3>
        <p><i>Which locations are most popular for visitors?</i></p>
        <p>
          The chart below shows, for each year, the number of visitors received
          by popular locations in Australia, along with the total expenditure of
          the visitors for each location.

          Use the slider below the chart to see how the data has changed over
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The slope of the dotted line shows the average spend of a visitor that
          year. Observe how the average spend of visitors generally increases
          over time. Locations above the line have an above average spend per
          visitor, and locations below the line have a below average spend per
          visitor.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="color: #8d5000; font-weight: bold">Sydney</span>
          consistently has the most visitors and total expenditure, but
          <span style="color: #b07aa1; font-weight: bold">Melbourne</span> often
          has a higher spend per visitor.
